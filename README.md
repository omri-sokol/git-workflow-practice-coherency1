# [Emojis Used to Increase Sentiment Analysis Data Accuracy](https://towardsdatascience.com/emojis-aid-social-media-sentiment-analysis-stop-cleaning-them-out-bb32a1e5fc8e)

I found this article because I'm interested in **natural language processing** and **sentiment analysis** is a topic under that field. This study states that in typical sentiment analysis, engineers try and filter out the use of emojis in order to resolve this variable and gain increased accuracy through text. However, this study shows that including them actually increases the accuracy of the sentiment analysis intelligence. 

This is interesting because we typically attempt to use emojis with different emotions. A sentiment analysis bot that is able to detect these features may allow us an insight into the use of emojis in society as well as how their meaning changes over time. For example, the :skull: emoji is used by many to express extreme laughter in a subject, when seeing skull in normal text, we may not be able to get that inference.

I thought this was interesting and funny because I use emojis a lot too. It would be cool if we could start including emojis to have more real conversations with AI and not mess up our data because in the real world we will have conversations that have emojis in them. - 163dgm
